However, the diff is truncated and does not provide evidence that the remaining required collections (Handmade Human Portraits, Marble Structures, Other Gods) were updated, nor that the referenced static image assets were added/are present under frontend/public/assets/generated.",

      "reason": "The diff shows unique images for Krishna/Ganesha/Shiva and begins Parvati, but the file is truncated and provides no evidence that Handmade Human Portraits, Marble Structures, and Other Gods collections were updated to have 4 distinct per-item images in each section.

      "reason": "While the excerpt shows unique /assets/generated filenames for several items, the diff is truncated before confirming the remaining collections. Additionally, no static asset files are shown as added/modified under frontend/public/assets/generated, so existence of the referenced filenames (and therefore 404-free rendering) cannot be verified from this diff summary.",
